# Mutual Funds Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting mutual fund performance using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes historical data to provide insights into potential future returns, helping investors make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes trends and relationships in mutual fund data.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assesses model performance using standard statistical measures.
- **Predictions:** Generates future mutual fund performance forecasts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mutual-fund-prediction.git
   cd mutual-fund-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `Mutual_Fund_Prediction.ipynb` file.
2. Run the cells step by step to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate predictions.
3. Analyze the output and visualization to understand the mutual fund trends.

## Dataset
The dataset should contain historical mutual fund data, including features such as:
- Net Asset Value (NAV)
- Expense Ratio
- Fund Category
- Historical Returns
- Market Trends

Ensure the dataset is properly formatted before running the notebook.

## Model Details
The prediction model may use:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks (optional)

Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation metrics (RMSE, R-squared, etc.) are included to ensure accuracy.
